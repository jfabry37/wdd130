    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>My favorite city is South Beach, OR. South Beach, Oregon is an unincorporated coastal
        community just south of Newport, located along
        Yaquina Bay and the Pacific shoreline. It’s known for its wide sandy beaches, outdoor
        recreation,
        and easy access to South Beach State Park, a popular spot for camping, hiking, and
        beachcombing.</p>
